# Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) â€” Transfer Learning with InceptionResNetV2

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify facial expressions into **positive (happy)** and **negative (angry, fearful, sad)** emotions using transfer learning on the **FER2013** dataset. A binary classification task is performed using a pretrained **InceptionResNetV2** model as a feature extractor, fine-tuned with custom dense layers.

---

## Dataset
- **FER2013**: A popular facial emotion recognition dataset with grayscale 48x48 pixel images.
- Selected emotions:
  - Positive class: Happiness (emotion label 3)
  - Negative class: Anger (0), Fear (2), Sadness (4)
- Balanced dataset with 8500 samples per class for training and validation.

---

## Model Architecture
- Base model: **InceptionResNetV2** pretrained on ImageNet, excluding the top classifier layers (`include_top=False`).
- Input shape adapted to `(139, 139, 3)` RGB images (converted from grayscale).
- Base model weights frozen during training.
- Added classifier head with:
  - GlobalAveragePooling2D
  - Dense layers with L2 regularization and Dropout for regularization
  - Output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification

---

## Preprocessing
- Raw pixel strings from FER2013 dataset converted to 48x48 images.
- Images resized to 139x139 pixels and converted to 3-channel RGB by repeating the grayscale channel.
- Preprocessing includes normalization via `preprocess_input` from InceptionResNetV2.

---

## Training
- Loss function: Binary Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.001)
- Early stopping on validation loss with patience of 10 epochs.
- Batch size: 128, max epochs: 50
- Dataset split:
  - 60% training
  - 20% cross-validation
  - 20% test

## Results on Validation Set
- Accuracy: ~79.4%
- Precision: ~80.7%
- Recall: ~77.5%
- F1 Score: ~79.0%

Confusion matrix visualization shows balanced classification performance.
